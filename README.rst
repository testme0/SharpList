SharpList
=============

As part of my new courses of "Paradigms of Programming" in Oxford Brookes University,
I've to develop 7 different programs in 7 different languages.
Two of them will be larger programs (but not too large ;)
and the five other will be smaller, more or less.

Time will tell if the five small programs will be small enough for me
to finish them before the end of the semester :)

SharpList project 
-----------------

So SharpList is one a the 5 small programs :

* Sharp for C#
* List for Check-List / ToDo-List

C# is one of the languages I've chosen and because a Check-List is
easier to read and process with a GUI, I made it using WPF.
SharpList allows you to create, delete, update a SharpList and add, check,
uncheck or remove items (remove is by Drag'N'Drop).
Data are stored into a simple data.xml file.

Enjoy ;)
